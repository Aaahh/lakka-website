Lakka is still under heavy development.

In its current state, the project allows you to play most games on most platforms.

However, expect some bugs, some features missing or not working the way intended, and some hardware not supported.

If you find a bug, you can declare it in our tracker, if it's not done already.

You can also get some help from the community, but the developpers are busy developping :)

We need help to improve our documentation, so if you feel you can contribute, please get in touch with us.
