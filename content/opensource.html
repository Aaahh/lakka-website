<p>Lakka is a community driven project. Coders, designers and gamers all around the world are working together to make it a great experience. Join us!</p>

<h2>Contributor profiles</h2>

<h3>Tester, documentation writter</h3>

<p>Lakka being available on a lot of different computers, it became difficult to test it manually. It takes more and more time to the developers to test the new builds on every officially supported hardware.</p>

<p>As a simple user, without any particular IT skill, you can be of a great help on that front. All you have to do is upgrading or reinstalling our nightly builds on a regular basis, and report any regression or bug on our issue tracker.</p>

<p>Contributors with such profile tend to develop a good knowledge of the various functionalities of Lakka, and often become contributors to the wiki.</p>

<p>If you are good at communicating, you can write news on our blog too.</p>

<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Playing video games, good written english, using Lakka, Markdown, github interface, using IRC</p>

<h3>Non technical community member</h3>

<p>We need people to hang on IRC and the forums to reply to the questions of the beginners. With some time, you will know every member in the team, and will be able to redirect the users to the right person. In a project like Lakka, having some positive and enthousiastic users staying online on the channel is very important. It is what make us a community.</p>

<p>If you love Lakka, and if you love to play video games and talk about it, please register on our Forum and join our IRC chan!</p>

<h3>System developer</h3>

<p>If you know Linux internals well, you can be a precious help on the OS development side. You can help maintaining the OS, upgrading the packages, and backporting some features from OpenELEC and LibreELEC.</p>

<p>Packaging new libretro cores is certainly the best way to get started.</p>

<p>But if you are skilled enough on this topic, you may want to help porting Lakka to new ARM boards.</p>

<h3>C developer</h3>

<p>RetroArch is coded in C. It is a very special software, that is able to run on a LOT of strange platforms: PSP, Wii, Blackberry, iOS, Android, GameCube, PS3, PS Vita, etc. It is also a software that evolves very fast. The number of daily commits and merged pull requests is impressive.</p>

<p>As a C developer, you can help us on a lot of fronts by contributing to RetroArch itself. But you can also contribute to the improvement of existing libretro cores, or even create your own libretro port of a new emulator or game engine.</p>

<h3>UX designer</h3>

<p>RetroArch was known in the past for its very conservative UI. In the last year, things have changed a lot and we moved to many kind of new GUIs, including the one used in Lakka. We need the help from ergonomy experts, to provide us with contructive remarks on how to organize the menus.</p>

<p>We are also looking for a very rare profile : a good C hacker with a very fine taste in UX. If you love Lakka and RetroArch enough, and if you are skilled in both C and UX, please join the developers on IRC.</p>

<h3>Themer</h3>

<p>Our menu supports theming. You can create your own theme, composed of icons, wallpaper, and font.</p>

<p>If your theme is great and covers enough systems, we can include it in Lakka.</p>

<p><strong>Skills:</strong> SVG, good taste in design</p>
