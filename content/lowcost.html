title: Lakka is low cost
---

<p>We try our best to keep the hardware required to run Lakka as cheap as possible. The software is optimized to run fast even on low end computers, and we support a lot of USB joypads.</p>

<p>Lakka is not a company, and we don't sell any hardware. The OS we build is available for free. Each user buy the require hardware by himself.</p>

<h2>Cost estimation</h2>

<p>Let estimate the cost of an average Lakka installation based on the popular Raspberry Pi 3. This little computer is a good choice for a beginner. It has built-in bluetooth and WiFi, and is compatible with a lot of TVs. Of course there are <a href="/powerful">other options</a>.</p>

<p>However, you certainly already own one or more of the required components.</p>

<p>It is very common nowadays to have an HDMI cable and a micro USB cable. You can use the charger of your phone, or directly plug the power cable to a USB port on your TV or any other electronic equipement near your TV.</p>

<p>The ethernet cable is only required on the first use, to configure your WiFi.</p>

<p>So if by any chance you already own a USB joypad, building your own Lakka Box will only cost you the price of a Raspberry Pi 3 : <strong>$40USD</strong>.</p>

<p>You can also buy some packs from webshops composed of a Raspberry Pi 3, a case, an SD card and a power cable. For example <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-essentials-kit">at Pimoroni</a>. But be careful with the taxes and the shipping cost. Depending on your location, it can be better to find a local shop.</p>

<h2>The live USB mode</h2>

		<p>Another good option if you want to keep the costs low is to run Lakka in Live USB mode. This mode allows you to play Lakka directly from a USB drive, without installing it on the PC.</p>

		<p>The performance will certainly be good, since most modern PCs are extremely powerful. You can store the games directly on the USB key. All the data will be saved on the USB, including screenshots, savestates, and even your settings.</p>

		<p>It is also a convenient way to test Lakka on various PCs, or to show your current game to your friends when you visit them.</p>
