Merry Christmas Lakka users :)

In this new release, we packed a lot of small improvements and bugfixes.

We know that a lot of you will use Lakka as a Christmas gift for friends and family, so we took time to test things twice before pushing the new builds on the servers. However, we can't test everything so it's better if you can check by yourself that all the aspects of the OS are working as expected.

## Changelog

 * RetroArch update (pre 1.4.0)
   * Asynchronous Wi-Fi scanner
   * Update system improvements
   * Various netplay improvements
   * A nice snow background effect (too slow for ARM boards)
   * Experimental savestate thumbnails feature (advanced setting)
   * Ribbon fix for XU4
 * Core updates
   * PPSSPP update
   * pcsx_rearmed update (also packaged for PC)
   * Beetle-PCFX update
   * glupen64 packaged for all images

   * More joypads supported, including new 8bitdo firmwares
   * Game database update (including FBA v0.2.97.39)
   * Overlays support (for cheap scanlines)
   * ION iCade support
   * New icon themes
   * Odroid-C1 kernel and bootloader update
   * More cores packaged for the H3 images
