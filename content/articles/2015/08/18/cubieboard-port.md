A generous donator from the libretro forums, nicknamed Kozimodo, donated this old Cubieboard.

Porting Lakka to Cubieboard was easy. We already support the Cubieboard 2 and Cubietruck of the same familly.

This board is comparable to a Raspberry Pi 1 in terms of performance.

The port is available in our [nightly builds](http://sources.lakka.tv/nightly/a10.arm/), with all basic functionnalities.

I will add the Cubieboard to the list of officially supported platforms just before our future release. There is no ETA yet.

Thanks to Kozimodo for donating this board!
