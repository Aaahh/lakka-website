[SolidRun](http://www.solid-run.com/) sent us two new devices: a Cubox-i4 and an HummingBoard-i2eX. Many thanks to them.

So Lakka is being ported to these and the result is already very promizing. They can both run smoothly snes9xnext, pcsx_rearmed, and sometimes vba-next.

There are still some rough edges that need to be polished before we can release, but you can already grab a nightly build from [here](http://sources.lakka.tv/nightly).

Feel free to try it and report the bugs you found!
