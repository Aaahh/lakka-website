The RPi Zero W is the new version of the RPi Zero with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

## RetroArch updated to 1.5.0

We usually don't update RetroArch during the release candidate cycle, but this new version is mostly about stability improvements and bugfixes.

 * Netplay works with more types of routers
 * New netplay icon tab styled
 * Lobby improvements, allows joining rooms hosted in your local network
 * Menu performance improvements
 * Ability to change the icon set on the fly
 * Adds a symbol page in the Virtual Keyboard (helps typing Wi-Fi passwords)

## Bugfixes

 * Fix keyboard typing not working in the menu, useful for people using laptops
 * Fix audio on S905
 * We switched to a more stable server to host the releases and the thumbnails (Thanks to the Patreon supporters)

## Installing or upgrading

Images are available here: [http://le.builds.lakka.tv](http://le.builds.lakka.tv) and are named with the version **2.0-rc3**.

You can upgrade directly from our menu if you're already using RC1 or RC2.

Thanks for your help. I hope you will be a lot to test this RC3 and declare bug reports!
