## First boot

Notice!: Some s8X2 boxes have trouble booting from an SD card. Please try using a regular USB Flash Drive if you have issues booting from an SD Card.

Follow the following steps:

1.  Insert the SD card into your Box
2.  Connect a HDMI wire from your Box to your TV
3.  Power on your TV
4.  Plug in an Ethernet wire (optional)
5.  Plug in a supported joypad into one of the USB ports on your Wetek Hub
6.  Plug in the power supply of your Box

You should see our splash screen:

The system will expand the file-systems and reboot after 30 seconds. This happens only on the first boot, the rest of the boots should be fast.

If everything went OK, you should now be able to navigate Lakka Menu, our graphical interface:

Congratulations, you have successfully installed Lakka!

You can now proceed to the final step.
