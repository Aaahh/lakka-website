## Adding and launching a game

### Adding a game using network share

Your Lakka Box and your Computer must be connected on the same Network. Please use an Ethernet wire for the Lakka Box, as we don't support WiFi yet.

Open your File Browser.

In the left column, you should see a *Network* icon:

Unfold this Network icon, and see if *Lakka* shows up.

If Lakka is there, clicking on it will lead you to a list of folders:

Copy your games under the *roms* folder. This step can take some time, as the games are transfered to the Lakka Box through your local network.

### Launching a game

Using your joypad, go to the *Load Content (Detect Core)* entry:

You should now be able to browse your ROM collection:

The game should be starting:
