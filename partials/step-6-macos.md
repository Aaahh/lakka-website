## Adding and launching a game

### Adding a game using network share

Your Lakka Box and your Computer must be connected on the same Network. Please use an Ethernet wire for the Lakka Box, as we don't support WiFi yet.

Open Finder.

In the left column, you should see a *LAKKA* icon.  
If LAKKA is there, clicking on it will lead you to a list of folders:

Copy your games under the *roms* folder. This step can take some time, as the games are transfered to the Lakka Box through your local network.

It is a good idea to start testing a Super Nintendo game, because they require no BIOS to run.

### Launching a game

Using your joypad, go to the *Quit RetroArch* entry:

![Reload content](/images/lakkamenuquit.png)

This will reload the graphical interface, and you should now be able to browse your rom collection:

![Browse roms](/images/lakkamenufindrom.png)

Select the rom you want to run:

![Run](/images/lakkamenurunrom.png)

The game should be starting:
